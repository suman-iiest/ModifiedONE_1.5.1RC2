# ModifiedONE_1.5.1RC2
Modified ONE Simulator
The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator is a Java based simulator intended for research in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). Apart from allowing users to simulate different DTN scenarios rapidly and in a versatile manner, it also offers an easy way to generate results from the simulations performed. Although the ONE simulator is widely accepted among the DTN research community as a standard DTN simulator, it supports only some limited features of DTN. The current release of the ONE simulator (version 1.6.0) only supports dissemination of messages with textual content over unicast mode of communication. The propagation of messages containing multimedia content and support for multicasting and broadcasting mode of communication are still not included in it. We propose to implement the multicast and broadcast modes of communication and dissemination of multimedia content in the ONE simulator. We augment the ONE simulator version 1.5.1 RC-2 to incorporate the proposed features.
